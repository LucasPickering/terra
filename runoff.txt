1. Start at highest tile (by elev)
2. Push ALL water to tiles with lower elevation
3. Water falls into ocean, or collects in lake basins
4. For each lake basin, cluster tiles that should form a lake
5. Split the water among each cluster

Problems
--------
Overly complex?
Could have a basin that is larger than that the runoff can fill - complicates clustering



1. Start at highest tile (by water elev)
2. Equalize water between each tile and its neighbors
3. Repeat x times (alternative: repeat until no changes occur)

Problems
--------
Requires indefinite # of iterations
May create infinite loop?
